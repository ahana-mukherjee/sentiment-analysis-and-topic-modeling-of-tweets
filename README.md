Sentiment analysis and topic modeling of Russia-Ukraine war-related tweets

I performed sentiment analysis and topic modeling on the tweets for the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. I extracted approximately 5,000 tweets from Twitter containing the following hashtags:


Using the generated data, I was able to determine the polarity and subjectivity of each tweet. Polarity is the intensity of an opinion, which may be positive or negative. Subjectivity is the degree to which an individual is personally invested in a topic, and it can be positive or negative as shown in in images attached below

I also performed Topic modeling on the data . Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that can scan a collection of documents, detect word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically cluster word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a collection of documents.

I performed the modeling with the LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation) model and then visualized the output with PylDavis(images attached). The model generated a cluster for 5 distinct topics that exemplified the various perspectives and emotions regarding the war.
